# MDD-OMC

Here's a draft for your README.md file for an AI prediction repository related to OMC (Optimum Moisture Content) and MDD (Maximum Dry Density):

```markdown
# AI Prediction for OMC and MDD

This repository contains code and resources for building, training, and deploying machine learning models to predict **Optimum Moisture Content (OMC)** and **Maximum Dry Density (MDD)** based on geotechnical soil properties. These predictions are useful in civil engineering and soil mechanics for optimizing compaction processes.

---

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Tools to clean, normalize, and prepare soil property datasets for training.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implementation of regression models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks.
- **Model Evaluation:** Metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R² for performance assessment.
- **Visualization:** Generate plots for data exploration and model results.
- **Deployment:** Export trained models for integration into web or desktop applications.

## Installation

Clone this repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-prediction-omc-mdd.git
cd ai-prediction-omc-mdd
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage

### Step 1: Data Preparation
Place your dataset in the `data/` folder. Ensure the dataset includes columns for relevant soil properties, such as:

- Grain size distribution
- Atterberg limits
- Soil classification
- Natural moisture content
- Bulk density

### Step 2: Training the Model
Run the training script with the following command:

```bash
python train_model.py --config config.yaml
```

### Step 3: Making Predictions
Use the trained model to make predictions:

```bash
python predict.py --input sample_input.csv --output predictions.csv
```

---

## Dataset

Ensure your dataset is in CSV format. A sample dataset is included in the `data/` folder for reference. The dataset should include features like:

- **Soil properties:** Specific soil characteristics (e.g., plasticity index, sand/silt content)
- **Target variables:** OMC and MDD

---

## Model Training

Configuration for the models can be adjusted in the `config.yaml` file. Key parameters include:

- **Algorithms:** Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks
- **Hyperparameters:** Learning rate, number of estimators, etc.
- **Cross-validation:** Define the number of folds for robust evaluation.

The training script automatically splits the data into training and testing sets, trains the model, and evaluates performance.

---

## Results

Model performance is reported using standard regression metrics:

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** Measures average prediction error.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** Penalizes larger errors more heavily.
- **R² Score:** Explains the proportion of variance captured by the model.
